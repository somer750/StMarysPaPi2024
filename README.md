# StMarysPaPi2024
St. Mary's School Horsham PA Raspberry Pi Competition

There are 7 modules in this project:

1.Data module
This is a stand-alone Raspberry Pi that collects and serves all the data
2. Teacher's Station
This is a module with a LED panel used to depict the children's moods. It also hosts a Grafana instance
3. Desk Module
This is a desk module that allows the children to express their mood by scanning their RFID card and entering a mood on a 1-5 point scale using the buttons
4. Boaty
This is the same as the Desk module, but designed to offer privacy to pupils who might not wish others to see their entries
5. Playground module
This is the same as the desk module, but meant for outdoors, where emotions can be much more difficult to handle
6. Panic Button
This is a module with just one button - it is located somewhere private when children can go when it all becomes too much
7. Head Teacher's alarm
This is a module that allows the class room teacher to call the head teacher if things are getting really difficult
